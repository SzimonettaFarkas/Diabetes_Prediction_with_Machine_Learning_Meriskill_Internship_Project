# Diabetes_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning_Meriskill_Internship_Project


Dataset:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of 
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
